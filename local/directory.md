# Known Directory Numbers

Information collated from several sources within the documentation currently available, shows that the following lines were allocated:

| No | Allocation | Notes |
|:---|:-----------|:------|
|  2 | Control Room Desks (3 lines) | The Misc Services Strip has this strapped up as tie-lines |
| 11 | PAX Test telephone | |
| 30 | Tele Cage | |
| 69 | Assistant Station Superintendents Office | |
| 72 | Boilerhouse Supervisors Office | |
| 74 | Shift Charge Engineers Office | |
| 75 | Boiler Feed Pump | |
| 76 | No.2 Turbine | |
| 77 | Plant Control (Plant Instrumentat Room A) | |
| 78 | Mr Babcock | |

Other numbers were certainly provided, but I've been unable to identify which numbers were allocated to the telephones installed.

# PAX renumbering

The numbering for the PAX appears to differ from the standard "as-issued" numbering scheme.  The mapping is as follows:

| Old Number | New Number | Notes |
|:-----------|:-----------|:------|
| 1x |  | Single digit facility, strapped to MH | 
| 2x |  | Single-Digit tie line style access | 
| 3x |  |  | 
| 4x |  |  | 
| 5x |  |  | 
| 6x |  |  | 
| 7x |  |  | 
| 8x | 8x | Single digit facility (no change, strapped to MH) | 
| 9x | 9x | Single digit facility (no change, strapped to MH) | 
| 0x | 0x | Single digit facility (no change, strapped to MH) | 

## REG T (Misc Services Block Renumbering)

| Original Designation | New Designation | Notes |
|:---------------------|:----------------|:------|
| 9 | 9 | Single Digit Access - Strapped to MH |
| 8 | 8 | Single Digit Access - Strapped to MH |
| 7 | 1 | Single Digit Access - Strapped to MH |
| 6 | 2 | Tie Line style strapping (to control room equipment?) |
| 0 | 0 | Single Digit Access - Strapped to MH |

# Access from London Transport Network
The following information comes from "Railway Automatic Telephone Directory" copies held by London Transport Museum.  They show how the numbering from the main London Transport Network changed over time.

My first working theory was that the following 2-digit access codes were tie-lines from the main LT network:

81xx - G.P.O Exchange, Shift Charge Engineer
82xx - 
83xx - 

However, none of the final 2 digit allocations match the 2 digit numbering described above, or the used-dial-label I have with 45 on it.  Was there more than one telephone system installed?
