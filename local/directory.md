# Known Directory Numbers

Information collated from several sources within the documentation currently available, shows that the following lines were allocated:

| No | Allocation |
|:---|:-----------|
|  2 | Control Room Desks (3 lines) |
| 11 | PAX Test telephone |
| 30 | Tele Cage |
| 69 | Assistant Station Superintendents Office |
| 72 | Boilerhouse Supervisors Office |
| 74 | Shift Charge Engineers Office |
| 75 | Boiler Feed Pump |
| 76 | No.2 Turbine |
| 77 | Plant Control (Plant Instrumentat Room A) |
| 78 | Mr Babcock |

Other numbers were certainly provided, but I've been unable to identify which numbers were allocated to the telephones installed.
